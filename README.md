Mammal Species Image Classification



# Objectives

Preprocess and understand a diverse mammal image dataset.
Develop and train deep learning models for multi-class image classification.
Compare model performances and fine-tune to achieve high accuracy.
Deploy a user-friendly interface for easy model interaction and prediction testing.

# Dataset

The dataset comprises 13,751 images across 45 mammal species, obtained from [XYZ Source]. It's been partitioned into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust training and evaluation of the models.

# Models Implemented

A custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
Transfer learning models utilizing pre-trained networks like ResNet and VGGNet.

# Technologies Used

TensorFlow 2.x
Keras API for model building and training
Streamlit for creating an interactive web application

# How to Use

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the model and explore the dataset.
Launch the Streamlit app to upload images and receive predictions in real-time.
